***** THE FUND RAISING APPEAL FOR CHOCOPIE IS CLOSED *****

We had to raise 37,034. However, by 7th July 11AM, we have collected 41,400. The additional money will help cover expenses for further X-rays, medicines and transport back to the dog's original place. If anything is still left, I will transfer the money to Baner/Balewadi volunteer's fund or contribute it towards any ongoing case thereon.

Hope Chochopie makes a full recovery soon.


Big thanks to all those who contributed. A contribution of 500-1000 rupees may not significantly impact our budgets, but it can give voiceless animals a chance at a new life. That is the power of a community.
